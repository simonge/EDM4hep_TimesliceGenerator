# Simplification Verification Checklist

## Pre-Commit Verification ✅

### Code Structure
- [x] Registry files deleted (7 files, 930 lines)
- [x] No remaining registry references in code
- [x] C++20 concepts preserved (CollectionTypeTraits.h)
- [x] Main files present and functional
- [x] Build configuration updated (CMakeLists.txt)

### Code Quality
- [x] Direct type matching replaces registry dispatch
- [x] All merge logic centralized in StandaloneTimesliceMerger.cc
- [x] C++20 concepts handle field detection
- [x] ROOT API used directly for type discovery
- [x] No hardcoded type checks remaining

### Documentation
- [x] SIMPLIFICATION_COMPLETE.md - Technical details
- [x] FINAL_SUMMARY.md - Executive summary
- [x] ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md - Visual data flow
- [x] Code examples and comparisons provided

### Alignment with Problem Statement
- [x] Create datasources → `initializeDataSources()`
- [x] Map branch → type → `discoverCollectionNames()` with ROOT API
- [x] Detect vector/ObjectID relations → C++20 concepts
- [x] Create matching output tree → `setupOutputTree()`
- [x] Loop sources/events/merge → `createMergedTimeslice()`

## Post-Testing Verification (Requires Build Environment)

### Build Testing
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] No undefined references
- [ ] No linker errors
- [ ] Executables created successfully

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Processes test input files
- [ ] Discovers all branch types correctly
- [ ] Applies offsets correctly
- [ ] Merges collections correctly
- [ ] Outputs valid ROOT files

### Output Validation
- [ ] Output file structure matches previous version
- [ ] Branch names and types match expected
- [ ] Data values match previous version
- [ ] No data corruption or loss

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Processing time comparable to previous version
- [ ] Memory usage comparable to previous version
- [ ] No performance regression

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Handles empty collections
- [ ] Handles missing optional branches
- [ ] Handles already-merged sources
- [ ] Handles multiple input files
- [ ] Handles Poisson vs static event modes

## Known Test Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Single Source, Static Events
```bash
./timeslice_merger -s -e 2 -n 10 input.root
```
Expected: 10 timeslices, 2 events each

### Test Case 2: Multiple Sources, Poisson
```bash
./timeslice_merger --config multi_source.yml
```
Expected: Timeslices with variable event counts

### Test Case 3: Bunch Crossing Mode
```bash
./timeslice_merger -b -p 1000.0 -d 20000.0 input.root
```
Expected: Events aligned to bunch boundaries

### Test Case 4: Beam Physics
```bash
./timeslice_merger --beam-attachment --beam-spread 0.5 input.root
```
Expected: Time-of-flight corrections applied

## Regression Test Matrix

| Test | Input | Expected Output | Status |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Basic merge | 1 source, 10 events | 10 timeslices | ⏳ |
| Multi-source | 2 sources | Mixed events | ⏳ |
| Bunch crossing | BC enabled | Aligned times | ⏳ |
| Beam physics | Beam enabled | TOF corrections | ⏳ |
| Already merged | Merged input | Correct offsets | ⏳ |
| GP branches | GP data present | Preserved params | ⏳ |
| All collections | Full data | All types merged | ⏳ |
